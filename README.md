Following Wes Bos' Flexbox Tutorial
Also aditional content to understand Flexbox

Main idea behind the flex layout is to be easy to alter items (width, height, order) to fit available space.

1. Introduction
- Flex container: the parent element in which flex items are contained. Fill available space or shrink items to prevent overflow.
- Flex Items: children of flex container

2. Flex Direction
- "flex-direction: row" is the default in any felx container
- "flex-direction: column" will stack the elements vertically on top of each other
- "flex-direction: row-reverse" will show the content in 'reverse' order. Content starts from right to left
- Same situation occurs in column-reverse: main access is from bottom to top.

3. Wrapping Elements
- "flex-wrap: nowrap" by default it is set in nowrap
- Adding margin to see space between flex items
- "flex-wrap: wrap" changes item
- "flex-wrap: wrap-reverse" changes the displayed items. Makes the cross Axis go from bottom to top. Still starting in the left side.
